# MicroServices
A collection of simple functions, written in Python and R, providing access to remote computation and remote data.
The microservices architecture is persuasively described by [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html),
claiming that software systems are most flexibly, robustly and adaptively created through composition,
in which each of the component parts each perform a single, well-defined task.

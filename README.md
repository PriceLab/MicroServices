# MicroServices
A collection of simple functions, in Python and R, providing access to remote computation and remote data.
The microservices architecture is described and argued for (here)[http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html]
by Martin Fowler.  The hypothesis is that software systems are most flexibly, robustly and adaptively created
through composition, in which the component parts each perform a single, well-defined task.
